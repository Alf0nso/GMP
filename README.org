* Monadic Parsing in Haskell
The majority of tutorials, blog posts, and general information around
the web related to Haskell's Parser Monads always goes back to the
paper: [[https://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pearl.pdf][Monadic Parsing in Haskell]] (by Graham Hutton and Erik Meijer).
Like mentioned on the abstract, it's a tutorial on how to define
recursive descent parsers in Haskell, making use of the structuring
capabilities of the language (coff coff Monads). This paper has
literally my age (it was published in 1998), and one could confirm that
it has indeed aged quite gracefully. Although the code associated with
the paper still probably runs with some help, it is a bit outdated in
regards to modern Haskell. If curious about what can be done about this
topic using modern Haskell I can advise on some tutorials:

* Warning (Warning)
This library is a small project of mine with the intention of learning
about this kind of parsers and using on my small homemade
interpreters/compilers/etc... It will probably be always a bit unstable
and suffer weird changes. If you want an actual industry standard
compiler of this kind you should look for: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec][megaparsec]]! Or it's
truly microscopic brother: [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yoctoparsec][yoctoparsec]]!
